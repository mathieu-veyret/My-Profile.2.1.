      <p>
        I was born on December 7th 2001 in Lyon and I still live there today. Lyon is a city with its own history and culture. It is the second best student city in France and the second best city in the world and that is why I am very proud to be from Lyon.

      <h2>My professional experience 👔</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I am currently working as a <strong>cashier</strong>. This student job is formative for me since I aim to do my master's degree in work-study and it allows me from now on to reconcile work and studies. It allows me to become more organised and gives me better rigour.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          During my first year at Esdes I did a 2-month internship as a <strong>customer advisor at Bricoman</strong>. This internship allowed me to gain real experience in the field and to discover the world of work. This experience taught me a lot about the importance of company management and the importance of communication between departments for the smooth running of the company.

      <h2>Sport 🎾</h2>
      <p>
      I'm a very curious person and I love to discover new things. I feel this in my practice of sport. I've always been involved in sport and it's something that has brought me a lot. I've been able to do team sports which taught me the importance of <strong>team spirit</strong> and <strong>collaboration</strong>. individual sports have greatly strengthened my mind. I was also able to compete, which gave me a <strong>taste for challenge</strong>.

      <h2>Music 🎵</h2>
        <p>
          Music is very important in my life. Unfortunately I don't play any instruments, but music is necessary in my life. I like to discover new genres, new artists.
